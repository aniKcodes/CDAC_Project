# Analysing and Visualising Trends of Global Warming and Predicting 2°C breach (from Pre-Industrial Temperatures) based on GHG

Under the Paris Agreement adopted in 2015, virtually all the world’s nations pledged to limit global warming to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels and also, if possible, “pursue” efforts to cap warming at 1.5C. At present, the world is not close to being on track to meet either target. 

# What we are solving
Here leveraging Machine Learning Models, we have tried to built a model that can, based on GHG emissions growth percentage, predict the year when the 2°C will occur. 

## What does the studies say
 - The world will likely exceed 1.5C between 2026 and 2042 in scenarios where emissions are not rapidly reduced, with a central estimate of between 2030 and 2032. 
 - The 2C threshold will likely be exceeded between 2034 and 2052 in the highest emissions scenario, with a median year of 2043. 
 - In a scenario of modest mitigation – where emissions remain close to current levels – the 2C threshold would be exceeded between 2038 and 2072, with a median of 2052.
